Requirements:
1) User email id creation.
2) Send/Receive email.

client -> LB -> User Service -> Redis -> RDBMS
       -> LB -> Mail Service -> Redis -> RDBMS
                    |
                    queue----------------------
                                               |
       -> LB -> Search Service -> Redis -> Elastic Search Engine

1)Email Id creation.
client send user email creation request.
Db: id, email id, mobile number, location
DB can be shareded based on location eg: India User DB, Australia DB
Redis: userid, user info

2)Mail Service
client sends email.
Email is saved in DB.
DB: from, to, date time, content
We can cache this info too.

Redis:
Send Cache -> email id, email content
Receive Cache -> email id, email content

3)Search:
Elastic Search can be used.
When email comes to email service, it further flows to queue from where it feeds into elastic search.
