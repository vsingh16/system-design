Requirements:
1)We have multiple elevators in a building. eg: 2 elevators in a building
2)Passenger can push either up/ down. i.e external request.
3)When elevator is at Passenger floor(as per external request), it will stop.
4)Once passenger enters, it will press destination floor no.
5)Once lift reaches destination floor, it need to stop and passenger will move out.
6)How system will decide which elevator will serve the request. i.e single external request and multiple lifts.
7)When there are multiple external requests.?
8)There are multiple passengers in the lift and it need to stop at all selected floor.

Class Modeling:
enum Direction{
up
down
}

External Request{
int currentFloor;
Direction direction
}

Internal Request{
int detinationFloor
}

enum ElevatorState{
moving,
idle
}

class Elevator{
int currentFloor;
ElevatorState state;
Set<Int> floorsToStop;
stopAtFloor(InternalRequest){
floorsToStop.add(InternalRequest.floor);
}

boolean shouldIStop(){
floorsToStop.contains(currentFloor);
}

moveToNextFloor(){
if direction is up, currentFloor++;
if direction is down, currentFloor--;
}

}

class ElevatorManager{
Set<Elevator> elevators;
void addElevator(Elevator elevator);
void removeElevator(Elevator elevator);//if elevator is not working/technical fault.

Elevator registerExternalRequest(External Request){

//Up Request : if there is a elevator.direction  = up && elevator.currentFloor <= externalRequest.currentFloor || elevator.idle
//Down Request : if there is a elevator.direction  = down && elevator.currentFloor >= externalRequest.currentFloor || elevator.idle

//If there are multiple elevators available, we will choose which one is near to me(elevator.floor - externalreq.currentFloor less)
and moving elevator gets  priortiy over idle.

}

initialise(){
elevators.run half of them in up direction and half of them in down direction.
}
}
