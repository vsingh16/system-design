Customer -> LB -> Customer Registeration Service -> Redis -> My SQL
               -> Search Service -> Redis -> Elastic Search Engine
               -> Order Service -> Payment Service -> Order Service DB(RDBMS)

Customer can create/update profile with Customer Registeration Service.
Since Customer detail is structred , we can user relational db.
Customer can do search with Search Service. Search Service is on top of Elastic search.
Cache is also there to hold most frequent searches, item images etc.
Order Service will take care of order creation and then further integrated with payment service.
Order info and payment detail goes to Order Db which will be transactional one. So RDBMS.


Restaurant -> LB -> Restaurant Registeration Service -> Redis -> My SQL
                 -> OnBoarding Service -> Redis -> NO SQL -> Queue -> Elastic Search Engine
                 
Restautanrts can register themself by registeration service.
OnBoarding Service will take care of adding/removing/updating new items.
Sicne this info can be unstrucrted(eg : momos : half plate : 6 momos, full plate: 12, half plate butter chciken: 2 pieces), we can go with no sql.
Information from this service will flow to Elastic Search.

Order FullFillment Service: This service will be at restaurnt's end and take care of order preparation.
