Requirements:
Find route b/w source & destination
ETA calculation

1)We know there are many algorithms to find shortest distance b/w source & destination in Graph. eg Dijikstars.
So GMAP applies same but we can't directlly apply this algo across the two points in country that will take much time & also its complicated to reprsesnt 
whole world on a graph.

2)It uses Quad Graph. Its a groah where each node has 4 children.
We can represent one country as a parent and then further keep dividing it into smaller nodes.
PS: Higher /Upper limit can be defined based on disucssion with Interviewer.

3)Now we can calculate routes & ETA b/w various nodes in a node and cache it.

4)To find route b/w two nodes(diff segments), there will be entry/exit point on each segment. 
We will find route b/w source& exit point + route b/w exit point of segment1 & entry point of segment2 + route b/w entry point of segment 2 & destination

5)ETA will be based on some standard calculation eg: car speed at 60KM/H covers 120 km in 2 hours.
This ETA will vary based on historic travel data, traffic updates etc.

Client devices are connected with web socket to location service.
This is continuously capturing current locations. This is getting stored in DB.
Also analytics is happening over it, capturing live traffic & travel time etc.
This info is updating Graph Processing service.
Data is getting feeded in Elatsic serach from Graph Service , and user search is supported.

PS: GMAP uses its own Bigtable(No SQL)
