Requirements:
Find route b/w source & destination
ETA calculation

1)We know there are many algorithms to find shortest distance b/w source & destination in Graph. eg Dijikstars.
So GMAP applies same but we can't directlly apply this algo across the two points in country that will take much time & also its complicated to reprsesnt 
whole world on a graph.

2)It uses Quad Graph. Its a groah where each node has 4 children.
We can represent one country as a parent and then further keep dividing it into smaller nodes.
PS: Higher /Upper limit can be defined based on disucssion with Interviewer.

3)Now we can calculate routes & ETA b/w various nodes in a node and cache it.

4)To find route b/w two nodes(diff segments), there will be entry/exit point on each segment. 
We will find
