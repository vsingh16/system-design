								Client and Server Communication
1)Http Communication:
These are mostly like REST API calls where client initiate request and server respond. Synchronous

2)Short Polling(AJAX):
Client at certain frequncey keeps sending request to server and server respond. In this case most of the respose will be null
as there will be no updates from server.
Drawback is too much calls.								

3)Long Polling:
Client makes a request to server.Now server will not immediatelt respond but maintain listb of client connections and will respond
on data availability. 
Drawback is latency and since server can only send one respose , client again has to make request and same process repeats.

4)Websockets:
Client and server make TCP handshake and establish connection once.
Now client can send data to server and server can send data to client.
eg: wassup where we send messages to server and any new message from server reaches to us.
Async Duplex communcation

5)Server Side Events:
Client initially makes request and then server will keep sending updates to clients.
eg: google map location update or uber driver location update.
