						Latency , Throughput, Response Time, Processing Time
client ->(T1)Server(processing : T2)
client(T3)<-Server(processing : T2) 						

T1: time for request from client to Server
T2: time taken by server to process request
T3: Time taken by server to respond

Latency : It is over network. T1+ T3 = Time for request/response over network
How to improve Latency:
1) CDN : Content Delivery Network. Request goes to geographically located server.
2) Browser Caching: static data like images and some CSS can be cached at browser.
3) Http2: with http2, client needs to create secure request TLS 1.2 and then multiple requets can be clubbed as stream 
in one request.
Http1: Sends only text request not encryupted and one request at a time.


Throughput : no of request processed by server in a second.

Response Time: T1+ T2 + T3. Time from request tiggered by clinet and response received.

Processing Time: T2 Time taken by Server to process request.
