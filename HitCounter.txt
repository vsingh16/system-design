Design a hit counter which counts the number of hits received in the past 5 minutes.
It should support the following two operations: hit and getHits.

hit(timestamp) – record hit at given timestamp.

getHits(timestamp) – Returns the number of hits received in the past 5 minutes (300 seconds) (from given timestamp).

HitCounter counter = new HitCounter();

// hit at timestamp 1.
counter.hit(1);

// hit at timestamp 2.
counter.hit(2);

// hit at timestamp 3.
counter.hit(3);

// get hits at timestamp 4, should return 3.
counter.getHits(4);

// hit at timestamp 300.
counter.hit(300);

// get hits at timestamp 300, should return 4.
counter.getHits(300);

// get hits at timestamp 301, should return 3.
counter.getHits(301);


Approach : Here we can take queue, where we will insert timestamp. Since it will be in an order, getHits(): will remove nodes which are not in range and then return
queue size. Time Complexity : O(n), Space Complexity : O(n) 

Secon Approach: Keep timestamp[], count[],
find index = time%300, if there is already value override it, since we only need to keep latest value.
If same time multuiple request comes, increase counter else 1
