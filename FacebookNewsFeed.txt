Problme Statement: Design Facebook News feed.

Step1: Clarify Requirements:
a) Feeds wil be based on users followed.
b) Feed can be text, image, video etc.
c) Publish Feed to all followers when a user add Post.
d) System should be scalable.

                                                                  ERD:
User(id, name, email, List<Integer> ids following, List<Integer> ids followers)
Feed(id, format, S3Path, User Id)

User Table : [id, name, email]
Relationship Table: [id, Follower_id, Following_id] : This table can answer me both things
who all a user is following.
Who all are followers of a user.

Feed Table: [id, format, S3Path, User Id]

Flow 1 : When user login and requests for feeds.
Feed Retrieval Service : This will accept user id and returns all the feeds for a user.
Feed Generation Service: Which will query DB and fetches all feeds from his followings , compile and return.
But since million of user data is there , making DB call and preparing this list on runtime will be slow, so we will Put a cache which will hold
100 latest feeds for a user. This service will retrieve data from Cache and retrun.
Cache can be LRU(LinkedHashMap)
<User Id, List<Feed>>

Communication B/w FRS and FGS is pull and push. This is like websocket communication where initial connection on login is establish by TLS handshake.
and now 2 way communication is possible.
Pull: when user login. FRS will pull data from FGS.
Push: FGS will send updates whenever feed list for that user is updated.

Flow2: When a user add a new post.
Feed will be stored in DB and cache is also updated.
