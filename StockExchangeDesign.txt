1) Client sends buy/sell order request on queue. This request is processed by Matching Engine.
2) Matching Engine : It is responsbile for matching order and sell requests and complete that.
Since its stock exchange, it should be very fast.
Below lists will be sorted order. i.e whenver any request comes, we keep comparing it with existing nodes to find its position. O(n)
Buy Linked List : 100/5 , 90/2, 80/1
Sell Linked List: 101/4, 98/3, 80/2

Matching engine will pick node biding higher cost . If it able to match it with sell bid, Order get executed.
Orders can be partially completed also.
