Flow 1: User Profile Creation
client(IRCTC website/ app) -> API Gateway -> user profile sign up -> User Service-> User DB(User Table)    

Flow 2: User Sign in / Search For trains
client(IRCTC website/ app) -> API Gateway -> sign in -> User Service
If user service returns success, then
client(IRCTC website/ app) -> API Gateway -> search -> Inventory Service
Search will be based on source, destination, date

Inventory DB: It will have train Table, train route, and train seat tables.
select id from train route where source = 'i/p source' and date(depature date) = 'i/p date' : source route id
select id from train route where destination = 'i/p destination' : destination route id
select * from train route where id between source route id and destination route id : This will retrun me all rows b/w
From this query , we can return train name in response.

Flow 3: Client -> API Gateway -> Booking Service
Check in train route table from row ids from above.
Calculate total distance and fare.
For fare, refer Train Seat Price : This will consider train category and seat price.
Also if available seat A counts are > 0.

Flow 4:Booking Service will send an event on queue to Payment service.
If payment success, then this will send back an event to Inventory Service.
Where it will update the seat count. This will reduce seat available count - booked seat count.

Flow 5: After Booking service update and event will be send to notification service.
Which will generarte tickets and send via sms/ email.
