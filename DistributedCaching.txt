As we know that in cache we have key and value pair.
This is like HashMap.
Now when we talk about distributed caching where multiple servers involved and autoscaling can also happen
Hashing % N way of distributing key will not work.

Suppose we have 3 servers, keys are distributed by hash % 3, now a new server is added.
hash % 4 : This will result in new locations and key will not be found in cache(cache miss) and data is loaded from DB.
Since this will start happening for almost 90% keys, DB will experience load and it may crash.
Similarly, if one of cache server is removed, hash % 2, will give new locations and same incident can happen.
