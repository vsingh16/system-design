                                                               SQL VS NO SQL
SQL or RDMS has fix schema. This become challenge with unstructred data processing and persistence.
There we have to choose No SQL DB.
eg:Oracle, Sybase, My SQL, MS SQL
PROS: select query is faster than NO SQL
Cons: Schema modification is difficult.

					                      Types of NO SQL DB

PROS: Schema modification is easy.
Cons: insert/delete query is faster.


1)Key Value Pair: 

key -> values
Name: age, city
Steve : 23 , lko

data:{
  name : Steve,
  age : 23
  address:{
	city: lko
  }
}
eg: Only two columns will be there , one is key and other is value.
eg: Redis, Dynamo DB(AWS)

Note that data is stored in key and value form.
Value itself can contain, keys.

2)Document Base DB: Data is stored in JSON, BSON and XML.
Article, Author
List<Subscribers>

articles:{
	author: "",
	replies: {}
}

Note: its not necessary that other article has replies. 
eg: MONGO DB, Postgress

3)Graph Based: It is used when data is more connected. Node is entities and edges represent relationship bw them.
It saves querying of joining multiple tables.
Social Networks.
eg: Neo4j

4)Column Based: Unlike traditional RDBMS where data is stored in row, data is stored in column.
So rather than scaninng all rows , we will scan only one row
eg: Casandra
RDBMS emp table : id, name, salary
id : all ids
name : all name
Salary: all salary
Col Based id table : having all ids
Name Table: Having all names
Salary: Having all salary
So if someone asks name and salary, so we can perform operation directly on name row to get all rows and then its corrseponding salary data.
