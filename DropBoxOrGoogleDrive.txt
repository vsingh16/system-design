Requirements:
1) Upload/Download
2) Sync Folder
3) History of Updates

Drop Box Client--------------------------upload---------------------> AWS S3(CLoud Storage)
[internal db,chunker,watcher]----------------------------->Messageing Service ---------------> Syn Service( Metadata DB)
                                                                        |
client 2 --------------------------------------------------------------

1) Upload:
One way could be client directly uploads file to S3.
In that case if file is of size 20 MB, 20MB storage happens in S3.
Now we edit file, since we need to keep versions, again 20MB file copy will be saved.
This is first problem to address.
We can divide files in chunks, so during first upload 10 chunks of 2 MB each gets stored.
For update, only updated chunk wil get stored not the whole file.

Now question arise how will we manage file seq etc.
So we keep metada info.
Metadata Table
(chunk hash id, file, user, client workspace)
chunk hash id : this will be unique for each chunk.
file: file name chunk belongs to.
user: who edited this file.
client workspace: from where this file get uploaded.

2)Sync Folder:
1)Client 1 adds some file.
2)Watcher at client 1 keeps checking for any updates.
3)Chunker will divide into chunks.
4)Metadata info is saved in local db.
5)Chunks are stored in S3.
6)Client 1 will send this information to Sync Service via messaging queue.
7)Sync service will update its metadata db and sends updates to other connected client devices for same user.
8)Other clients will recieve updates and update their internal Db & sync folder.

3)History of updates: Since we are keeping multiple copies for updates & has this info in db.

Note: we need SYnc service/central service , so that we can reflect same files in other connected clients.
We need internal DB for fast db access/metadata info & this helps in case we are offline.
Once we come online, we can save to cloud & notify sync service.
In case other clients are offline, they will have updates from sync service on messagin queue which they will get once online.
